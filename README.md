# AI Travel Companion 

## Project Description  

Travelers often face challenges when visiting unfamiliar destinations such as:
- Language Barriers
- Cultural Understanding
- Safety Concerns

Many applications such as Google Translate, Google Lens,  Trip Advisor, etc. only address some of these issues that travelers deal with. 

The AI-Powered Travel Companion integrates translation, landmark recognition, safety alerts, and personalized recommendations for travelers. Unlike existing tools (Google Translate, Google Lens, TripAdvisor, or general-purpose AI chatbots), this project provides **real-time, contextual, and personalized support** tailored to the traveller’s location, preferences, and needs.

## Goals  

1. Develop a **web-based AI travel companion** that integrates translation, landmark recognition, safety alerts, and personalized travel recommendations.  
2. Provide **real-time, contextual support** (translation, cultural insights, etiquette tips, safety notifications).  
3. Deliver **personalized experiences** tailored to travellers’ interests, preferences, and location data.  
4. Enable **direct API integrations** for bookings, maps, and AI services. 

## Key Feature  

**Real-Time Translation with Cultural Context**  
- Provides both **voice and text translation** in real-time.  
- Goes beyond word-for-word translation by offering **cultural and etiquette guidance** to help travellers communicate respectfully and effectively in unfamiliar environments.
